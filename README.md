## **Premise** <br />
The HeyBlue App Project is a sustained effort that facilitates moments of meaningful connection between police officers and members of their community by offering intentional opportunities for individuals to meet and share positive experiences. These positive interactions turn into points that the individual can use to purchase items and the police officer can donate to a non-profit or family in need.
